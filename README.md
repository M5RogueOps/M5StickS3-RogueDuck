ROGUEDUCK V2 is a custom, tactical firmware that transforms the M5Stack StickS3 into a covert, dual-network BadUSB tool. It features a complete mobile-first web interface, on-the-fly DuckyScript parsing, cloud-payload fetching, and a cyberpunk CRT hardware UI.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌐 Dual-Mode Networking (AP + STA)

* **Station Mode (STA):** Automatically attempts to connect to a predefined mobile hotspot or local network for internet-enabled attacks.
* **Access Point (AP) Fallback:** Always broadcasts its own isolated `RogueDuck_Sync` network so you are never locked out of the command center.

### 📱 Mobile-First Web Command Center

A stealthy, dark-mode web application optimized for fat-thumb operation on smartphones.

* **Over-The-Air Uploads:** Push `.txt` DuckyScript payloads directly to internal storage (LittleFS).
* **Live Editor:** Write, edit, and save payloads directly from your mobile browser.
* **Cloud Vector Deployment:** Paste a raw URL (e.g., GitHub Raw, Pastebin) to fetch and execute a payload entirely in RAM, leaving no trace on the device's physical storage.
* **Remote Execution:** Trigger any stored payload instantly from the web app.
* **Panic Wipe:** A dedicated killswitch at the bottom of the UI that formats the LittleFS partition, permanently wiping all stored payloads in seconds.

### 📟 Hardware Interface

* **Cyberpunk CRT Aesthetic:** Simulated CRT scanlines, dynamic glitch effects during injection, and dynamic IP rendering.
* **Pocket Lock & Battery Saver:** Long-press the side button to dim the screen and disable the physical injection buttons, preventing accidental misfires in your pocket.
* **Live Telemetry:** Real-time battery percentage monitoring directly on the header.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

* **Device:** M5Stack StickS3 (ESP32-S3)
* **Connection:** USB-C (For flashing and HID emulation)

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Flashing

### 1. Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed in the Arduino IDE:

* `M5Unified`
* `LittleFS`
* `USB`
* `USBHIDKeyboard`
* `HTTPClient`
* `WebServer`

### 2. Configuration

Before compiling, open `ROGUEDUCK.ino` and update the Wi-Fi credentials at the top of the script:

```cpp
const char* AP_SSID = "RogueDuck_Sync";
const char* AP_PASS = "12345678"; <--- Change This to what ever you want

const char* STA_SSID = "YOUR_HOTSPOT_NAME"; <--- your SSID 
const char* STA_PASS = "YOUR_HOTSPOT_PASSWORD"; <--- Your SSID Password

```

### 3. CRITICAL: Partition Scheme

Because this firmware utilizes heavy web assets, dual Wi-Fi, and HTTP clients, it exceeds the default 1.2MB ESP32 application limit.

* In Arduino IDE, navigate to **Tools > Partition Scheme**.
* Select **Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)** or **No OTA (2MB APP/2MB SPIFFS)**.
* Compile and Upload.

## 🕹️ Operation Guide

### Physical Controls

* **Button A (Front):** `INJECT PAYLOAD` - Executes the currently selected payload.
* **Button B (Side Short-Click):** `SCROLL` - Cycles through stored payloads.
* **Button B (Side Long-Press):** `POCKET LOCK` - Toggles the battery-saver dim mode and locks the physical execution buttons.

### Web Controls

1. Connect your smartphone/PC to either the `RogueDuck_Sync` Wi-Fi network OR the shared Hotspot network.
2. Check the M5Stack's physical screen for the assigned **IP Address**.
3. Enter the IP into your web browser.
4. Use the GUI to upload, edit, fire, or wipe payloads.

## 📜 Supported DuckyScript 1.0 Syntax

The internal parser processes standard US-English layout DuckyScript 1.0 commands:

* `STRING` / `STRINGLN`
* `DELAY` / `DEFAULT_DELAY`
* `GUI` / `WINDOWS` / `COMMAND`
* `CTRL`, `SHIFT`, `ALT` (and combos like `CTRL-ALT-DELETE`)
* `ENTER`, `TAB`, `SPACE`, `ESC`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`
* `F1` - `F12`
* `REM` (Comments)
* `REPEAT`


---
## 📋 To-Do / Roadmap

* [ ] **DuckyScript 3.0 Support:** Upgrade the parser to handle variables, logic, and `IF/THEN` statements.
* [✅] **Captive Portal:** Implement a DNS server in AP mode so connecting to the `RogueDuck_Sync` Wi-Fi automatically opens the Web UI.
* [ ] **BLE Keyboard Emulation:** Add the ability to inject payloads wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy instead of just physical USB.
* [ ] **International Keyboard Layouts:** Expand character mapping beyond US English to support UK, DE, FR, and ES layouts.
* [ ] **Data Exfiltration:** Add a listener endpoint to capture keystrokes or data from the target machine and save it to `LittleFS`.
* [ ] **Status LED Integration:** Utilize the M5Stack's built-in RGB LED for visual status cues (e.g., Breathing Blue = AP Mode, Solid Green = STA Connected, Flashing Red = Injecting).
* [✅ ] **Tunneling Companion Guide:** Add documentation and a companion Python script for setting up Ngrok/Cloudflare reverse tunneling for global access.
